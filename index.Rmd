## Experimental Design  

![](./rey.jpeg)  

Welcome to **#exptsandbox #sciencejedi** training.  
The sandbox is a perfect metaphor because there is no perfect experiment - but we can do better experiments!  
<br>  

### Outline      
This course examines advanced concepts associated with the design and implementation of experiments in environmental and evolutionary biology. Both basic and applied designs are described and major contemporary developments summarized.

### Lectures
Read. Think. Create.  

The first 6 weeks, we read a book together. This component of the lectures provides you with the critical elements, ideas, tools, and terminology you need to design better experiments.  The extent that you develop your knowledge and design skills are evaluated using a test, provided in advance, that you complete on your own time.    

 
The next 6 weeks, you design an experiment for graduate-level research and prepare an NSERC grant proposal (very short, see guidelines). The primary purpose of this component of the lectures is to provide you with the opportunity to generate a novel, useful research proposal on a topic of your choice. Key readings and discussion are provided to support your development and exploration of a topic.

### Textbook
[Experimental Design for the Life Sciences Fourth Edition](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/experimental-design-for-the-life-sciences-9780198717355?cc=us&lang=en&)  
<br>  


### Labs 
Learn by doing.  

There are two components to the labs. The first component is a field experiment. You are provided with three options. Try each briefly, then decide on the one that you want to pursue in depth and write up.   

The second component of the labs focuses on reuse of data already collected. This is increasing common practice in the sciences, and it is an opportunity to apply design thinking to data and write a short research note. These relatively recent 'note' formats are succinct papers in most peer-reviewed science journals now used to report on a single finding and advance theory without a protracted introduction, methods, or discussion.
